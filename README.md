# Spatiotemporal modeling of fossil pollen records
This repo contains archived code for constructing continuous pollen surfaces over large geographic regions and long time periods. Surfaces are created using a polya-gamma stick-breaking model based on [Linderman et al's (2015) work.](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rpa/pubs/linderman2015multinomial.pdf)
Updated versions of this model are only available through a private repo. The current repo will eventually be updated to reflect these changes.
